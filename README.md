# LLRB-Tree implementation for Go

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/maolonglong/llrb)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/maolonglong/llrb)

This repository contains an implementation of a Left-Leaning Red-Black (LLRB) tree in Go. The LLRB tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that provides efficient operations for insertion, deletion, and search.
